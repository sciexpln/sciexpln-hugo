This is just a bit of information about me. I'm a graduate student
working on computational biology. And an avid reader of fiction,
history, and popular science. This website is an attempt to discuss science, 
whether it be an interesting popular science book, a new interesting scientific 
discovery reported in the newspaper, or even memes about (pseudo-) science floating around in cyberspace.
