This is just a bit of information about me. I'm a graduate student
working on computational biology. And an avid reader of fiction,
history, and popular science. This website is an attempt to analyze and
discuss in detail, as well as evaluate the evidence for and against
memes about (pseudo-) science floating around in cyberspace.
