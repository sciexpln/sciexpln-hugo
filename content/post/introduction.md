Science is interesting. Very. However, it has long lacked popular appeal. It has just not been eyecatching. 

This, however, is rapidly changing. From eminent scientists and science popularizers like [Prof. Richard Dawkins](https://richarddawkins.net/), [Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/), [Prof. Lawrence Krauss](http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu/) and [Prof. Brian Cox](http://www.apolloschildren.com/) to an army of internet activists for science like [SciBabe](http://www.scibabe.com/), [BiologyBabe](https://www.facebook.com/BasicBiologyBabe/), [A Science Enthusiast](https://ascienceenthusiast.com/) and many more, lots of people are working to making science fun and interesting, as well a clearing up a lot of misinformation floating around on the internet about various aspects of science and technology.

As not only a student of science but also a big fan of the scientific enterprise, I would like to add my two bits to the spread of awareness or science, whether it be discussing an interesting popular science book, a new interesting scientific discovery reported in the newspaper, or even combating the deluge of pseudo-science online. This website is a result of that effort. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
