There is a lot of misinformation floating around on the internet,
including misinformation about various aspects of science and
technology. From eminent scientists and science popularizers like [Prof.
Richard Dawkins](https://richarddawkins.net/), [Dr. Neil deGrasse
Tyson](http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/), [Prof. Lawrence
Krauss](http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu/) and
[Prof. Brian Cox](http://www.apolloschildren.com/) to an army of internet activists for science like
[SciBabe](http://www.scibabe.com/),
[BiologyBabe](https://www.facebook.com/BasicBiologyBabe/), [A Science
Enthusiast](https://ascienceenthusiast.com/) and many more, a lot of
scientists and engineers are speaking out against pseudoscience. As not
only a student of science but also a big fan of the scientific
enterprise, I would like to add my two bits to the spread of awareness
and combating the deluge of pseudo-science online. This website is a
result of that effort.
